                    <p class="description">We facilitate an atmosphere and ambience that celebrates these differences
                        and
                        backgrounds in a warm and nurturing environment.</p>
                    <p>We believe that how children are treated and in turn how they treat others is of paramount
                        importance
                        in making them into good human beings and responsible citizens.</p>
                    <p>Our committed and hugely talented faculty work as a cohesive team to accomplish the goals and
                        objectives of our school. To this end, we focus not only on pure academic objectives but also on
                        your
                        childâ€™s personality and emotional development.</p>

                    <p class="description">Middle School is a critically defining point in the educational career of a
                        student. It serves as a bridge between Elementary School and High School, and has a long-term
                        impact on
                        a student's readiness for future academic challenges. At Middle School, students begin to take
                        more
                        responsibility for their learning and the teacher assumes the role of a facilitator.</p>
                    <p>Students are presented with leadership roles at school events, Round Square meetings and Sports
                        and
                        Cultural competitions, where they imbibe the qualities of sportsmanship, team-spirit,
                        perseverance and
                        resilience.</p>
                    <P>Since the Middle School years, being a period of transition, can be an emotionally challenging
                        phase
                        for children, we provide an environment which fosters easy and open communication between staff
                        and
                        students. It also encourages creative ways of dealing with conflict. In preparing students for
                        high
                        school, we try to instill a sense of independence and personal responsibility.</P>
